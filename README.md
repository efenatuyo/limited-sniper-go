limited sniper 


pretty easy to use.

1. Go to config json and change your cookie
2. You can set your own global price. Global price means before buying a item the item price can't be more than global price
3. if you wanna add a new id just create a new dict in `items.list` like this `item_id(string): {"max_price": int}`  

btw this is the 3rd language I made this in :joy:
